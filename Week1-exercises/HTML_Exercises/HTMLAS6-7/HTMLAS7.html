    <h1>Welcome to The History of Cake and Brownies</h1>

    <p>Cake's origin can be traced back to ancient times, with the concept evolving over centuries. The first recorded evidence of cake-making dates back to ancient Egypt, where sweetened bread-like treats were baked using honey and nuts. As civilizations progressed, the Greeks and Romans enhanced cake recipes with ingredients like eggs and butter, laying the foundations for the diverse and indulgent cakes enjoyed today.</p>

    <p>Brownies have a more recent origin, emerging in the United States in the late 19th century. The first-known brownie recipe was published in the Sears, Roebuck catalog in 1897. Legend has it that brownies were created by a chef who forgot to add baking powder to a chocolate cake, resulting in a dense, fudgy treat. Brownies quickly gained popularity due to their simplicity and rich chocolate flavor, becoming a beloved dessert enjoyed worldwide.</p>
